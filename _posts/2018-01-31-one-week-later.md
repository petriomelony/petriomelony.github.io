Wow, a whirlwind week since my last post.  Been helping Natasha get settled and it's been so amazing to have her around again.  Also I've been taking charge of dinners at home so mom doesn't feel to stressed when she gets back from work.  Dad suggested it, and it seems to be helping!

Helping Natasha has made me realize again how crazy our banking and telecom systems are in Canada.  By crazy I mean not user friendly at all.  The banks all have multiple "products" (ie: accounts) to choose from, with various fees and "perks".  I hate that.  Why not just act like a bloody bank?  I'm giving you my money to keep safe, you get to invest it, I should get some compensation (ie: interest).  Instead, Canadians have to pay ridiculous fees, can't withdraw money from other ATMs without fees, can't do this without fees, can't do that without fees.  It's crazy.  Telecom isn't much better, with even the most basic phone plan costing at least $10, with nothing more than a few minutes and texts.  No voicemail, no call display... it really is a bit third world.

In other news I had a job interview, which hopefully went well.  We'll have to wait and see!  I really like the look of the company, and it seems right up my alley.  Fingers crossed!

Natasha and I were playing a cool game yesterday called Overcooked.  It was developed in Unity, but it's a multiplayer chaotic cooking game.  So fun, and crazy.  Nick mentioned it to me a while ago but I hadn't tried it until last night.  Natasha really likes it too.

Here's a pic of it in action:

And that's about it for now!  Hopefully this image post works ok with Jekyll.
