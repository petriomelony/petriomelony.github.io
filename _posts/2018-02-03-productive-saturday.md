Today was a really productive day! We woke up around 9 and made French toast and pancakes for breakfast. I had the French toast (cinnamon raisin) and Natasha had the pancakes.  Coffee too but I can't wait til we can have freshly ground stuff again, been using this terrible maxwell house preground stuff that's probably from an office in the 2000s.

We also did a ton of laundry, cleaned our washroom, and then I made some egg bread.  The joys of adulting are real! I applied to the Waterloo board yesterday so hopefully they get back to me soon. Been having teaching dreams again also!

Here's what the bread looked like, Natasha helped me with the braiding because I can never do it properly.

It was quite delicious, nothing like making homemade bread. I think I still prefer French bread though.
