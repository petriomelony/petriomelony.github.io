How relevant that I should be starting a new blog with a post called New Beginnings on the eve of a new beginning for me and Natasha.  She gets here tomorrow!  So crazy.  It feels like the last 5 months have just flown by.  I don't want to lose as much time as I have already, gotta keep doing stuff as I say.

Today I started this website, and got the functionality semi-close to how I want it.  I used the infinite scroll javascript from tobiasahlin to get the blog posts flowing near the end of my page (I figure anyone who makes it to the end may actually want to read what I write!), and I used this spiffy Jekyll theme to make it look half decent.  I'll keep tinkering with it until I get it exactly how I like it, I'm not really keen on orange, not can I really offer any services.  Hopefully this will just be a repository for people to see my various projects.

But until then, here's to the start of a new project!
